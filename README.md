# contact_reverse

The app reverser.py, replaces display name and last name with each other in a '.vcf' file.

    You will need python installed on your computer.
    Download it from: www.python.org
######
    The vcf file that you give the program should be named: 'old.vcf' and located in the same directory with reverser.py.
    Run the app.
    The the app will give you a new vcf file named: 'reversed.vcf'.

Good Luck :)
